*Code quality refers to the overall excellence of a computer program's source code. High-quality code is clean, efficient, and well-structured, making it easy to understand, maintain, and scale. It adheres to coding standards, has minimal bugs, and is adequately documented. Code quality directly impacts a project's success, as it reduces development time, enhances collaboration, and ensures a smoother user experience. Maintaining high code quality is crucial for long-term project sustainability and success.*
- **Readability:**
Code should be easy to read and follow.
Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
Maintain consistent coding style and indentation.
- **Efficiency:**
Code should be optimized for performance.
Avoid unnecessary loops, redundant calculations, and resource-intensive operations.
- **Consistency:**
Follow coding standards and best practices consistently.
Ensure uniformity in naming conventions and code structure.
